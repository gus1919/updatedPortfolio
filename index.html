          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Greetings, my name is Justin Oeters, pronounced like eight-ers, and
            I have been interested in programming and computers since my first
            Apple IIe in the 80’s. As a youth, in addition to computers, I was
            also a member of the Boy Scouts of America and a member of several
            sports teams. I graduated high school fourth in my class and have
            earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree as well as attended
            one year of law school. My education invoked my thirst for knowledge
            and I strive to learn new things every day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Regarding employment, I have had several jobs ranging from retail
            work to probation. My longest career paths have been as a customer
            service representative for Best Buy and currently, a Probation
            Officer for Butler County. Working for Best Buy, I learned about
            working with people and overcoming adversity as well as best
            business practices. As a probation officer, I learned to supervise,
            distribute tasks, and keep people motivated to stay on task.
            Although my employment has been rewarding, I am ready for greater
            challenges.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My experiences have taught me to be a dedicated worker and to do
            more than produce a mediocre result. I am always willing to learn
            new things and devote extra time to making a product that is not
            just good, but phenomenal. As an employee of your company, I would
            bring all my skills and knowledge to make us as successful as
            possible and further my knowledge even if it is not necessary.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">In this project, were to add a current date function and a 
            table representing the work day (I used 7am to 7pm). From there, you could enter 
            text into the time blocks and the blocks would be color coded based on the time 
            of the day. The information would be stored locally so that if the screen is 
            refreshed, the data persists. It was a solo project created using HTML, CSS, and 
            Javascript. </p>
