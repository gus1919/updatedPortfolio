          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Greetings, my name is Justin Oeters, pronounced like eight-ers, and
            I have been interested in programming and computers since my first
            Apple IIe in the 80’s. As a youth, in addition to computers, I was
            also a member of the Boy Scouts of America and a member of several
            sports teams. I graduated high school fourth in my class and have
            earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree as well as attended
            one year of law school. My education invoked my thirst for knowledge
            and I strive to learn new things every day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Regarding employment, I have had several jobs ranging from retail
            work to probation. My longest career paths have been as a customer
            service representative for Best Buy and currently, a Probation
            Officer for Butler County. Working for Best Buy, I learned about
            working with people and overcoming adversity as well as best
            business practices. As a probation officer, I learned to supervise,
            distribute tasks, and keep people motivated to stay on task.
            Although my employment has been rewarding, I am ready for greater
            challenges.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My experiences have taught me to be a dedicated worker and to do
            more than produce a mediocre result. I am always willing to learn
            new things and devote extra time to making a product that is not
            just good, but phenomenal. As an employee of your company, I would
            bring all my skills and knowledge to make us as successful as
            possible and further my knowledge even if it is not necessary.
